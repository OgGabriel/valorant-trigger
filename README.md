# valorant-cheat
Valorant cheat that uses Logitech GHUB driver input management and color detection.

# features
  - Triggerbot with customizable delay (VK_SHIFT)
  - Recoil control system with customizable recoil reduction amount

# requirements
This cheat requires Logitech GHUB driver to be installed on the machine that is
running the game/cheat. You can download it for free at https://www.logitechg.com/en-us/innovation/g-hub.html.
You don't need a Logitech mouse, even though it can be buggy on other mice (couple of my friends had some issues idk).

# detection rate
I've been occasionally using this cheat since the beta on a test account and on my main (got 2 keys, lucky :3)
and I've never even gotten a warning or a ban on those accounts. This version has a different type of
input managing than my private version since..

# IMPORTANT
Since this project will be released to the public soon enough (it's released yay), you must know that there are certain risks of a 
Riot developer stumbling upon this. I am not responsible for any bans/penalties you receive on your accounts.
Updating this cheat isn't hard, if you have more than 2 braincells you will be able to use it for a loooong time.
